# FraudTransactions
This program implements and combines simple algorithms for finding potentially fraudulent credit card activities. The program uses a text database of financial transactions ( transactions.txt ), where each line contains a single transaction. An example line from the file: 2019-08-01 23:54:09 | $47.10 | Miller Ltd | +1-109-904-2332 The four fields of the transaction are separated by a | character and some optional white spaces. The first field is the date and time of the transaction (using the 24-hour format), the second field is the USD amount, the third is the name of the merchant, and the last field is the merchant's phone number. It is a good idea to open this file in Spyder to better understand the format.
