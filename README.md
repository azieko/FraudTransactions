# FraudTransactions
In this assignment, you are going to implement and combine simple algorithms for finding potentially fraudulent credit card activities. You are given a text database of financial transactions ( transactions.txt ), where each line contains a single transaction. An example line from the file: 2019-08-01 23:54:09 | $47.10 | Miller Ltd | +1-109-904-2332 The four fields of the transaction are separated by a | character and some optional white spaces. The first field is the date and time of the transaction (using the 24-hour format), the second field is the USD amount, the third is the name of the merchant, and the last field is the merchant's phone number. It is a good idea to open this file in Spyder to better understand the format. Also, you can re-use some parts of your previous homework for processing this file. You are going to read this database and implement several filtering functions to find irregular activities. Finally, you will combine these methods to find potentially fraudulent transactions.
